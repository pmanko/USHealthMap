## <http://vizhub.healthdata.org/subnational/usa>


### Overview
The US Health Map tool, created by the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://www.healthdata.org/about), provides impressive online data visualization capabilities for mortality, life expectancy, and risk factor data across the United States. The underlying datasets are part of the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx), a catalog of data compiled and managed by IHME. This catalog aims to gather and standardize world-wide public health data generated both by IHME initiatives and outside sources. The US Health Map tool uses a subset of this data catalog to allow for the visualization of health trends across the United States. 

### Features

1. **Dataset Selection** - provides the choice for the visualization of *Life Expectancy*, *Mortality Rates*, or *Risk Factors* on the map. 
2. **Locations** - provides the ability to select of multiple states or counties for comparison of data. *Warning - selection of locations should match the selected Administrative Division (3). If `State` is chosen in the Administrative Division (3), county data will not show up in the time trend (6) or colored dot plot (7). Time trend (6) comparisons between counties and states do show up if Admin. Division is set to county and both county and state locations are chosen.*    
3. **Administrative Division** - allows the choice of the granularity of the displayed map and dotplot data between `State` and `County`.
4. **Sex** - Filters the displayed data by a specific sex.
5. **Time Interval** - Filters data by specific year. Use of the slider allows for the visualization of trends over time. Play button automatically animates the year-to-year transitions.
